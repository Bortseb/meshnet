Meshnet @ DWeb Camp 2019
========================

The 2019 Decentralized Web ~Summit~ Camp will take place at a beautiful piece of coastal land an hour west of San Jose from July 18 to 21.
This area currently has very minimal network infrastructure and Internet connectivity.
Let's use this opportunity to build, test, and use our decentralized systems together,
in a connectivity environment that more closely resembles large parts of the world,
and co-imagine the social processes and local technologies that will help us organize day-to-day,
and make inclusive spaces to learn from each other and build capacity around human-empowering technologies.

## Goals

This document is the proposal to build a local mesh network with the following goals in mind:

- Reliable local network with 802.11ac speeds
- Access points in key areas for client devices (e.g. phones and laptops) to connect
- Allow Camp participants to extend or run locally-hosted services on the network
- Carry traffic to Internet gateway for client devices to access the Internet with limited bandwidth and reliability
- Document setup and learnings for future events or other groups
